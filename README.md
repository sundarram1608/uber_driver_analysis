# uber_driver_analysis
This project is based on the trips made by Uber drivers.

Here, we are analyzing different aspects of the trips by doing Exploratory Data Analysis.

Essential data science libraries listed below are leveraged to perform Exploratory Data Analysis using Python.

***Libraries leveraged:***
> NumPy

> Pandas

> Matplotlib

> Seaborn

***How to use the repo?***
- Fork and clone the repository
- Install the above libraries (virtual environment recommended) if not available using the command `pip install` in terminal
- Open the `code.ipynb` file and run all the cells.(Same Folder hierarchy as in repository to be used)


**This detailed analysis was performed by me as a part of my course work in Post Graduate Program in Data Science & Business Analytics**
